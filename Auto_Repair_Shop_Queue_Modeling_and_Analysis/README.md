Abstract:  
In this paper, two queueing models (FIFO, First In First Out and OCF, Oil Change First) were
developed and studied for the services of automotive repair shops. We controlled and varied
system parameters (customer arrival rates, number of technicians, customer tolerance
parameters), and analyzed wait times and customer retention. We then analyzed the
profitability of a special 30 minute oil change offer. We discovered that an OCF queue has
more benefit for shops that are overwhelmed with work, while the special offer is only beneficial
to shops with too few customers.
