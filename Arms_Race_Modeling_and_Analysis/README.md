Abstract:  
In this project, we analyzed a simple Richardson arms race model to determine whether it
provides realistic results and useful insights. We did an eigen­analysis on the model to predict
how the stability and overall behavior of the system is related to the model’s parameters. We
discovered that the system’s stability is heavily dependent upon the relationship between the
“defense” parameters and the “fatigue” parameters, whereas the position of the fixed point is
influenced by the interaction of all parameters. The model proved to be a good starting point for
determining whether an arms race might occur. However, a more sophisticated model is
required to make realistic predictions of the expenditure levels during an in process arms race.
